# Food Poisoning Project
Project focuses on analysis of data from Reddit and social media regarding the matter of food poisoning events in the US. Initial idea: can data from Reddit be substantial on this matter? Can we visualize the analytics or provide any geographical data?

Sources and tools used:
- Reddit (API)
- Twitter (API)
- CDC data sets
- NORC data sets
-----------------------

My portion of the project focused on work with direct data from users submitted to iwaspoisoned.com.
I was able to scrape the latest reports from twitter, and create a dataframe with reports locations and venues. The data was visualized via Basemap. At the moment the maps for the United States were not updated in the library, so I used the newer maps provided by US Census.
